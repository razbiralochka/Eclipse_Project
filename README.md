Eclipse. Many space missions support our understanding of the Sun - our nearest star - and its significant impact on our lives here on Earth and on our plans to send human and robotic explorers to the Moon, Mars, and beyond! Our project is to develop a method to improve public awareness and understanding of these spacecraft and how the valuable data they provide impacts the way we live and work. The thrill of developing a mission as challenging as Parker Solar Probe emboldened the science community and raised its aspirations. NASA launched the Heliophysics 2050 program to extend the vision and goals for missions and science by 2050 and beyond. Therefore, we are going to launch our own orbiting solar nanotelescope. The nanotelescope will receive images of the Sun such as the SOHO orbiting spacecraft.
